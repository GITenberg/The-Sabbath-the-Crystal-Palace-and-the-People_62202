<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
SABBATH, THE CRYSTAL PALACE, AND THE PEOPLE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> relation between the Church of
Christ and human society has long been ill-defined and
unsettled.&nbsp; The Church has to present to society, in its
struggles and sufferings, an aspect in which the kindliness of
human sympathy and interest is blent with the severity of truth;
and this is always difficult.&nbsp; Between worldly compliances
on the one hand, and bigoted formalities on the other, it is hard
to strike the mean.&nbsp; Between the two extremes the Church is
prone to alternate.&nbsp; This question,&mdash;&ldquo;The opening
of the Crystal Palace during a portion of the Lord&rsquo;s
Day,&rdquo; demands the statement of the feeling and thought of
the Church upon this subject at the present time.&nbsp; The
spirit of a party is quite as significant as its acts and
expressions, for that spirit is a living fountain, out of which
other acts and feelings will flow forth; and as the utterance of
the mind of the Church upon this great question will probably
determine the character of its relation to, and influence on <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>society for
some years to come, we should watch most carefully, not over our
words and deeds only, but over the spirit in which we address
ourselves to this discussion.&nbsp; We must be prepared either to
reform or re-affirm our first principles, as to the relation
between the Church and the human world&mdash;for this is,
emphatically, a question of first principles; it has been dealt
with too much in detail; we must look to the foundations if we
would settle it aright.&nbsp; Nor is it a matter of merely casual
and momentary importance to which party we attach ourselves, and
what cry we raise.&nbsp; The party will do more work on us
personally than we shall do for the party.&nbsp; It is possible
(it has been so before, it may be so again) that we may be taking
for ourselves and for the Church many backward steps, by joining
ourselves unthinkingly to those who, whether right or wrong,
certainly are most loud and dogmatic in their tone.&nbsp; It is
possible, that by calmly taking our stand on a principle which
has but few supporters, we may find ourselves, though we appear
to stand alone on earth, in holy fellowship with the clear-eyed
watchers of all earth&rsquo;s transactions, who bend over
heaven&rsquo;s blue cope to regard us, and with the God of truth
and love.&nbsp; Therefore let us watch and pray while we
thoughtfully consider this question, for it is a solemn matter,
and affects the weal of the Church and the world, and our own
with them, far more deeply than at first appears.</p>
<p>Before entering on the argument, I may be allowed to state, in
a few words, the reasons which have induced me to place my
thoughts upon this subject before the public.&nbsp; At the last
meeting of <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>the Congregational Union, I took occasion to state my
objection to a proposed petition from the meeting against the
opening of the Crystal Palace on the Lord&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; I
was, at the time, wholly unsupported, but have since found reason
to believe that there was a large amount of hearty and
intelligent sympathy with my objections which did not express
itself.&nbsp; I wrote to the editor of the <i>British Banner</i>,
stating the fact, and developing more fully my views.&nbsp; Since
the publication of my letter, I have been subjected, in the pages
of religious papers, to misconstructions and misrepresentations,
especially from anonymous correspondents.&nbsp; This was, of
course, to be expected; but hardly, perhaps, the singular want of
comprehension, both of my views and of their own, which some of
the letter-writers displayed.&nbsp; Having an intense dislike to
a newspaper warfare, I felt it due to myself and many of my
brethren to state calmly my views, and to advocate them to the
best of my ability.&nbsp; Whence this address to Christian
people, which I offer with sincerity and earnestness, trusting to
their Christian charity and candour to give a fair consideration
to the principles and conclusions which it sets forth.&nbsp; I
have thrown my argument into the form of an address, which, for
many reasons, I prefer.</p>
<p>The question to be considered in the following pages is
this:&mdash;&ldquo;Is it wise and right for us, as Christians, to
offer any opposition to the opening of the Crystal Palace during
a portion of the Lord&rsquo;s day?&rdquo;&nbsp; I trust that all
into whose hands this may come, are of one mind as to the value
and importance of the Sabbath.&nbsp; But there are those who take
the negative on this <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>question, who are as loyal to the Sabbath, as honestly
desirous to have it better and more extensively observed, as the
straitest of those who have set themselves forth as its special
defenders.&nbsp; In making this clear, it will be needful to
examine the views of the great parties who have expressed
themselves against interference in this matter, but on grounds
with which I cannot accord.</p>
<p>There are many who take no part in the protest of, at any
rate, a large portion of the religious public, simply on the
ground that an appeal to Government, on any subject involving
religious principles and considerations, is undesirable in
itself, and dangerous, inasmuch as it may be made the precedent
for future interference, in some more serious form.&nbsp; Gallio
is their model ruler, a man &ldquo;who cared for none of these
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; They hold that the State should have no
thought and no voice on such matters.&nbsp; That such a movement
as that of the Crystal Palace Company may safely be left to stand
or fall by its own merits.&nbsp; If it be good, they are sure it
will come to something; if bad, they have a happy faith that it
will come to nought.&nbsp; No doubt, such theories have a strong
intrenchment in the order of a ruling Providence.&nbsp; Somehow,
good things do live, bad things do die, notwithstanding
man&rsquo;s efforts to the contrary; but still, bad things are
long a-dying, and God expects us all&mdash;rulers, too, according
to the measure of their rule&mdash;to help to end them, and get
them decently buried out of sight.&nbsp; Had there been a
petition to Government to open all the beer-shops in the kingdom
all day and all night on the Sabbath, and the Government said
yea, <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>should
we dare to sit calmly by, and trust that the evil would cure
itself?&nbsp; Is it not the business of Government to help to
protect, by governmental effort and action, the whole community
from the effects of the worst passions and most degrading views
of the community?&nbsp; Though, no doubt, the highest condition
of a State is that in which a healthy, moral, public feeling
renders such interference needless.&nbsp; We have hardly yet
arrived at this Utopia of politics, and this excessive jealousy
of Government, in the present condition of England, obstructs
many useful measures.&nbsp; The objection to Government
expressing itself on this subject seems to be a radically unsound
one.&nbsp; The question must be discussed on quite other
principles, if a healthy settlement of it is to be made.</p>
<p>There is a second party, which refuses to join in the protest
through indifference to the Sabbath, or latitudinarian views of
its nature and claims.&nbsp; To them, the Sabbath appears to be
simply a human institution; a thing invented by priests for
priestly purposes; an enslavement of man&rsquo;s free spirit; a
formalism which mars the pure essence of devotion, makes it a
thing of times and seasons, and desecrates every other day that
it may consecrate one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every day is a
Sabbath,&rdquo; according to this doctrine; to attach holiness to
any particular day, is to rob all the rest of the holiness which
belongs to them.&nbsp; To tell a man that he can worship best in
sanctuaries in Sabbath seasons, is to fetter his right and
liberty of worship at all times and places; and, in short, the
Sabbath is regarded as the very key-stone of that arch of
formalism on which the Church rears the superstructure of her
power.&nbsp; Such is the latitudinarian <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>view of the Sabbath; and, of course,
those who hold it, rejoice in the prospect of the opening of the
Crystal Palace on that day.&nbsp; In order to discern the
falseness of their views, we must glance at the true idea of the
Christian Sabbath.</p>
<p>Of all the popular cants of the day, perhaps that is at once
the most pretentious, and the most heartless, which asserts a
necessary antagonism between form and spirit, soul and body, the
spiritual and the material, and sets itself up as the special
champion of spirit and the spiritual, by maintaining that all
forms and organizations, all times and seasons, all modes and
habitudes, are systematic conspiracies against the liberties and
rights of men.&nbsp; This is the latest resurrection of the old
ascetic spirit, and must end&mdash;as all attempts to emancipate
ourselves from the conditions of life and development which God
has implied in the constitution of our being and of all
things&mdash;have ended, in blank immorality and shameless denial
of all moral law.&nbsp; This is the great danger of our
times.&nbsp; It is not formalism that we have chiefly to
fear.&nbsp; There is more peril of our casting off all form and
order, than of our being mastered and bound by any one.&nbsp; The
Sabbath is of God.&nbsp; He who causeth the outgoing of the
morning and evening to rejoice, causeth the outgoing of the
Sabbath morning to rejoice over the human world.&nbsp; He who
gives to the weary body the refreshment of nightly slumber, gives
to the weary mind and spirit the rest of the Sabbath day.&nbsp;
We may steal the hours from slumber, but the wrong will in the
end avenge itself; and it is at our peril, and to our certain
detriment as men, societies, <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>or nations, that we steal its offices
from the Sabbath. The moon, the fairest and the benignest
minister that attends our earth, marks out our weeks for
us.&nbsp; She chimes with notes of silvery clearness the sevens,
while the sun intones the units on the bells of time.&nbsp; In
full tune with living nature we keep our Sabbaths.&nbsp; We enter
into the universal harmony when we consecrate our seventh
day.&nbsp; This surface analogy rests on the deepest principles;
and if, to any, this orderly procession of the Sabbaths seem a
formalism, a yoke of bondage, then the day, the night, the
periodic mealtime, the Christmas festival, the birthday greeting,
must be to them a torment and an insult.&nbsp; The arrangements
of all things must be, to such, a maddening discord.&nbsp; Even
the primitive simplicities of barbaric existence, if they could
recur to it, would not emancipate them.&nbsp; But such an
experience might, perhaps, convince them, that these
consecrations are the records of a vital progress&mdash;that
these seasons, cut off from the lump of untrained, untrimmed,
unformed existence, are the string courses of the masonry of that
living temple of society, which mark the lines of its emergence
from the dark ocean of primitive barbaric chaos and night.</p>
<p>A tendency to think lightly of what has been consecrated by
the religious feeling of the pious for long generations, is by no
means a beautiful or commendable thing.&nbsp; We may be sure that
some deep reason underlies the disposition of pious minds with
one consent, through successive ages, to fall into a certain form
or mode of action and thought.&nbsp; God has other ways of giving
to the world commandments than by <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>speaking or writing them.&nbsp; It is
as distinctly a command of God to us to work by day and sleep by
night, as if it had been written on the tables of stone; and any
organized attempt to violate it exacts the penalties of a broken
command.&nbsp; And God has given to all men an implicit direction
to observe a Sabbath, in the instinct of its need which he has
implanted in the constitution of humanity.&nbsp; This is
witnessed even among the most degraded peoples, who have wandered
farthest from the first condition, and most injured the original
constitution, by means of the miserable substitutes wherewith
they are fain to supply its place.&nbsp; But the question might
fairly be asked here&mdash;&ldquo;Is this all the obligation of
the Sabbath day?&nbsp; Is it simply, that as sleep is good for
the body every night, so it is good for man that, once in seven
days, he should rest from his labours?&nbsp; If this be all,
where is the religious obligation of the Sabbath?&rdquo;&nbsp;
No, this is not all.&nbsp; When we speak of a man resting from
his labours, we speak of a <i>man&rsquo;s rest</i>, and not of a
brute&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A brute rests from toil that he may renew
the tension of his muscles; a man, that he may renew the tension
of his soul.&nbsp; A <i>man&rsquo;s</i> work is not the work of
his muscles only, nor is a <i>man&rsquo;s</i> life the life of a
labourer, of a student, of a priest, but all these in
unison.&nbsp; And when God said, &ldquo;Thou shalt rest on the
seventh day from all thy work,&rdquo; he said it to
<i>man</i>&mdash;to a being endowed with a spirit capable of
&ldquo;looking before and after,&rdquo; capable of looking up to
Him, whose natural and joyful employment, on his rest-days,
should be to refresh his higher powers, by special direction of
them to their appropriate objects, lest he should become <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>embruted by
his needful daily toil.&nbsp; We cannot separate, even in
thought, when we look at it in relation to God, between the rest
of the Sabbath and spiritual activity and devotion.&nbsp; The
fact, that it is a <i>man</i> for whom God provides the Sabbath,
seems to indicate the kind of use which is to be made of
it.&nbsp; The man who deliberately holds himself back from a high
exercise, of which God has made him capable, and prefers to make
his Sabbath more like a brute&rsquo;s than a man&rsquo;s,
commits, in relation to it, that most heavy of transgressions,
&ldquo;a coming short of the glory of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
a sin which no written law can touch&mdash;an inward sin, a sin
of life, which consists in living below the idea which God has
implanted; a sin which may co-exist with the most perfect legal
righteousness, and which can only be denominated &ldquo;<i>a
coming short of the glory of God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Human rulers
may separate in their legislation between the rest and the
religious purpose of the Sabbath; they may say, &ldquo;The first
we will care for, it is within our province; the second we can
take no cognizance of by formal statutes;&rdquo; but the Divine
Ruler can make no such separation.&nbsp; To rest from toil, and
to restrain the thoughts and the heart from going out through His
creation and up to Him, is to commit that sin against Him which
the Apostle specifies as the fundamental transgression&mdash;a
coming short of His glory.&nbsp; You see that it is a sin which
may be committed in churches and chapels, as well as in parlours,
in Parks, in Crystal Palaces, and on sea beaches.&nbsp; I fear,
the Sabbath is not to any of us what it ought to be, in the
measure in which it ought to be&mdash;a season of inward renewing
of strength for daily labour&mdash;a height to <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>which God
affords us leisure and strength to climb, that we may look beyond
the stars which watch our daily travail, to <span
class="smcap">Him</span>.</p>
<p>Thus far we have hardly glanced at the Sabbath as a positive
institution of the Lawgiver and Ruler of this world.&nbsp; The
view of the Sabbath which has already been presented, seems to
underlie all Divine legislation (and there is such) upon the
subject.&nbsp; This is the foundation on which it rests, towards
the realization of this it works.&nbsp; We miss much of the
meaning of the old Jewish legislation, by not going deep down
beneath the positive commandment, and studying, as we are
able&mdash;nay, if friends of Christ, bound to do&mdash;the
necessity out of which the law arises, the feature of the
original Divine constitution which it is intended to illustrate
and guard.&nbsp; This method will bring us into true tune with
the commandment, our observance will then be spiritual, that of a
friend, a child, not a slave.&nbsp; Every law must have its
reason in the nature of things, must be intended to direct
attention to, vindicate, or restore, some reality which is in
danger of being disregarded.&nbsp; It is needful to see what is
behind the law, in order to understand it truly.&nbsp; God saw
that there was in man a fearful tendency to deny the God that
made him, by withholding himself from the higher exercises, the
higher life, of which God made him capable&mdash;getting rid of
spiritual burden and care, and making his life as much like a
brute&rsquo;s as it could possibly become.&nbsp; He saw,
moreover, that the struggle between the higher element and the
lower, the spirit and the flesh, which had broken loose from the
spirit&rsquo;s control, would be a long and sharp one, in each
human soul, and in the world <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>at large; and, tenderly
compassionating his afflicted and distracted prodigal children,
He came, even in the very hour of their apostacy, to help the
higher nature in its conflicts, and finally give to it the
victory by allying it for ever with himself.&nbsp; His purpose of
mercy had a methodic development&mdash;first the germ, then the
blade, then the ear, and after that the full corn in the
ear.&nbsp; He chose Abraham as the man through whom He would
enter into relations with his descendants, the Jewish people,
constituting them the people through whom He would enter into
relations with the whole human world.&nbsp; He gave to the Jews a
law, the purpose of which was to bring out the original features
of the constitution of man, and his primal relations to God and
to all things.&nbsp; That which had been lost in the fall was
re-established by the Jewish economy, and every ordinance of God,
which man, the sinner, had trampled upon and spurned, was brought
forth again, and sealed afresh, in the sight of all the people,
and, through history, in the sight of all men, with the seal of
the Almighty and the All-wise.&nbsp; The Jews, in this solemn
covenant, were the representative people, through whom God was
addressing the whole human race.&nbsp; It was, above all things
needful, to bring out the idea that there was power to support
the original constitution of things, though man had been suffered
to attempt, for a time, at any rate, to violate it.&nbsp; God
needed to bear most solemn witness before men, that no violation
of it could be successful; that it was girded with the living
splendour of His righteousness, and sustained by the terrible
resources of His power.&nbsp; This, man had forgotten.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; said one, in <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>wanton
contempt of the law of that relationship of brotherhood which had
been established by God.&nbsp; &ldquo;These be thy gods,&rdquo;
said others, as they danced around their golden calf, and, under
the very shadow of Sinai, made light of the living Lord.&nbsp;
Men were growing wanton in the unbounded license to sin, to break
every Divine command without immediate and palpable
penalty.&nbsp; God had to tell this people, and through them the
world, with a terrible simplicity and sternness which even they
could understand, that an awful sanction attended the original
unwritten laws which He had established, and that the penalty of
a systematic breach of them must be death.&nbsp; Let us take the
legislation on the Sabbath as a specimen.</p>
<p>The law is written thus, Exodus xx. 8, 9, 10,
11:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Remember the Sabbath day</i>, <i>to keep it
holy</i>.&nbsp; <i>Six days shalt thou labour</i>, <i>and do all
thy work</i>; <i>but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God</i>: <i>in it thou shalt not do any work</i>,
<i>thou</i>, <i>nor thy son</i>, <i>nor thy daughter</i>, <i>thy
man-servant</i>, <i>nor thy maid-servant</i>, <i>nor thy
cattle</i>, <i>nor thy stranger that is within thy gates</i>:
<i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</i>, <i>the
sea</i>, <i>and all that in them is</i>, <i>and rested the
seventh day</i>: <i>wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
day</i>, <i>and hallowed it</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The comment on it
is given in Exodus xxxi. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>And the Lord spake unto Moses</i>,
<i>saying</i>, <i>Speak thou also unto the children of
Israel</i>, <i>saying</i>, <i>Verily</i>, <i>my Sabbaths ye shall
keep</i>: <i>for it is a sign between me and you throughout your
generations</i>; <i>that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth
sanctify you</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ye shall keep the Sabbath</i>,
<i>therefore</i>; <i>for it is holy unto you</i>: <i>every one
that defileth it shall surely be </i><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span><i>put to death</i>: <i>for whosoever
doeth any work therein</i>, <i>that soul shall be cut off from
among his people</i>.&nbsp; <i>Six days may work be done</i>;
<i>but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest</i>, <i>holy to the
Lord</i>: <i>whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day</i>,
<i>he shall surely be put to death</i>.&nbsp; <i>Wherefore the
children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath</i>, <i>to observe the
Sabbath throughout their generations</i>, <i>for a perpetual
covenant</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is a sign between me and the children
of Israel for ever</i>: <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth</i>, <i>and on the seventh day he rested</i>, <i>and
was refreshed</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been said that this is a
too tremendous sanction to a mere formal institution.&nbsp; We
have seen that this is not a mere formal institution, a day
appointed arbitrarily by the Lawgiver, as for wise reasons our
lawgivers appoint days and seasons upon earth.&nbsp; It is a part
of the original constitution, a beam through the gloom of the
first sentence, &ldquo;<i>In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat
bread</i>;&rdquo; a station for man the wayfarer to rest and
refresh himself, as he ploughs and digs, and fights and forces
his way through the jungle of earth to God.&nbsp; God, in this
Sabbath institution, is bringing out a fundamental and primal
law, and He gives to it the very highest sanction, a witness to
all fundamental laws that the breach of them is death.&nbsp; That
God did not regard it as a mere formal institution is most
evident, in that He himself protests against the mere form of it,
when it was offered to him as a sacrifice widowed of the
congenital soul.&nbsp; Isaiah i. 13&ndash;15.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Bring no more vain oblations</i>; <i>incense is an
abomination unto me</i>; <i>the new moons and Sabbaths</i>,
<i>the calling of assemblies</i>, <i>I cannot away with</i>;
<i>it is iniquity</i>, <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span><i>even the solemn meeting</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth</i>:
<i>they are a trouble unto me</i>; <i>I am weary to bear
them</i>.&nbsp; <i>And when ye spread forth your hands</i>, <i>I
will hide mine eyes from you</i>: <i>yea</i>, <i>when ye make
many prayers</i>, <i>I will not hear</i>: <i>your hands are full
of blood</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Sabbath of the Jews was a
perennial monitor, pointing backwards to the earliest time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Remember the Sabbath day</i>,&rdquo; remember the
fountain of present and familiar liberties and joys.&nbsp; The
time came when the alphabet of morals had been conned and
thoroughly mastered, when the whole world was to be put into
possession of treasure which had been accumulating in the hands
of the Jews for ages.&nbsp; It is a fine illustration of the
manner in which Judaism in its living germs, which had never been
suffered to perish, expanded into Christianity, to trace the
transition from the Jewish Sabbath to the Sabbath of the
Christian church.&nbsp; It is more true, perhaps, to speak of
growth than transition.</p>
<p>It seems very strange to some that a feature of Judaism so
strongly marked, has so little formal recognition and
reinforcement in the New Testament.&nbsp; What is the foundation
of the Christian Sabbath?&nbsp; On what ground of reason or of
law does it rest?&nbsp; Of law, none whatever.&nbsp; To the
Pharisees, the men who sat in Moses&rsquo; seat, Christ appeared
to be a Sabbath breaker.&nbsp; Whatever His estimation of it, His
conduct with regard to it was such, that it could at any rate be
said, with a colour of truth, &ldquo;<i>This man is not of
God</i>, <i>because he keepeth not the Sabbath
day</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On every occasion on which there is a
question on the subject, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Christ appears in strong antagonism
to the Churchmen of his time; and on one occasion he defends
himself by an appeal to an irregularity of David, which he
justified on the ground of necessity; a mode of defence which
must have greatly surprised them, which surprise he takes no
pains to mitigate.&nbsp; And yet, mark you, he never allowed that
he violated the spirit of the Sabbath institution; nay, he
charged the rigid Sabbatarians with the violation, giving them a
new lesson to learn&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Go ye</i>, <i>and learn what
that meaneth</i>, <i>I will have mercy and not
sacrifice</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the rest, we have to gather the
Sabbath law out of the New Testament in the following
fashion:&mdash;</p>
<p>On the first day of the week, the Saviour arose from the dead,
and laid the foundation of a new creation.&nbsp; On the first day
of the week, Jesus appeared to his disciples, (John xx. 19 and
26.)&nbsp; On the first day of the week, the Apostles were
baptized with tongues of fire.&nbsp; On the first day of the
week, the disciples came together to break bread at Troas, (Acts
xx. 7.)&nbsp; On this day Paul thinks a work of charity specially
graceful and appropriate, (1 Cor. xvi. 2.)&nbsp; There is little
doubt, but no decisive evidence, that the assemblies of
Christians alluded to &ldquo;passim&rdquo; in the Epistles, are
to be referred to this day; and John, in Patmos, &ldquo;<i>was in
the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s day</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; As far as
the New Testament is concerned, we believe that this is
all.&nbsp; Some, then, might say that it is simply by implication
and inference, and not by distinct commandment, that the Church
keeps a Sabbath.&nbsp; The Jewish Sabbath, with all its awful
sanctions, vanishes, and no one can quote any law of the New
Testament <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>which sets up anything in its place.&nbsp; No one can
show by what authority the day was altered, nor tell how far the
authority, which changed the day, could transfer the sanctions
and penalties from the old day to the new.&nbsp; In mere word,
this is true enough.&nbsp; It is untrue enough, at heart.&nbsp;
How does the Sabbath come down to us?&nbsp; As a day set apart,
through all Christian ages, by the deliberate consecration of the
whole Catholic church from apostolic times.&nbsp; We must not
rail too much at tradition.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s day is
certainly more a tradition than a commandment.&nbsp; And what, in
the Christian church, is the office of the Spirit in relation to
Divine things, and, among them, Divine laws?&nbsp; Is it not the
office of the Spirit to lead men to see from within the wisdom
and goodness of the commandment, and lovingly to adopt it;
showing to the soul of man the wisdom of the Divine constitution
in everything, and securing, not a formal, but a loving adhesion
to it; abandoning entirely the system of formal prohibitions and
penalties, as inconsistent with the method of grace and of
love?&nbsp; Does the absence of a Divine testimony against theft
or adultery, in Christ&rsquo;s epitome of the commandments,
legalize theft or adultery?&nbsp; And does the absence of a
renewed formal announcement of the original Divine provision for
man&mdash;the Sabbath-day&mdash;mean that God ceases to care for
it, that He annuls the first constitution, and leaves man to work
on till death like a brute?&nbsp; On the contrary, it means that
the Spirit of God, and not the law, has taken charge of the
institution, and that He will make its power felt and its worth
acknowledged, wherever <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>He bears witness within human
souls.&nbsp; But it is a very terrible sin to take it out of His
charge, and make it law again, by presenting it in any other way
than He presented it to the early Christian world.&nbsp; Has not
the Lord&rsquo;s day come down to us just as we should have
anticipated&mdash;through the Spirit?&nbsp; Was there not a deep
reason beneath the old institution, Exodus xxxi.
17&mdash;&ldquo;<i>It is a sign between me and the children of
Israel for ever</i>: <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth</i>, <i>and on the seventh day He rested</i>, <i>and was
refreshed</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is there not as deep a reason
underneath the new?&nbsp; Is it not the <i>Lord&rsquo;s
day</i>?&nbsp; The Jewish day commemorated a creation complete;
the Christian Sabbath, a creation begun.&nbsp; The one a last
day&mdash;the finishing of a work&mdash;looking backwards to the
original condition and constitution; the other a first day, with
the week days, the ages, the eternities before it, commemorating
a new condition and constitution, or the old one transfigured, to
bear fruit through a future eternity.&nbsp; For myself, I would
handle as reverently the Lord&rsquo;s day which the Spirit has
delivered to us through the Church, as the Jew his Sabbath,
protected by the penalties of the law.&nbsp; Only, as Christians,
we are bound to go further back than the Jew could go, dared go,
even beneath and behind the commandment, and enter into the
counsels of Him who gave to us the Sabbath day.&nbsp; We are to
regard the purpose and spirit of the Sabbath.&nbsp; A man who
goes to church twice and worships, and thinks that therein he has
fulfilled the law of the Sabbath, and brands him as a law-breaker
<i>ipso facto</i> who has never been to church at all, fearfully
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>misunderstands the matter.&nbsp; The thing is good; its
goodness is now its argument; and that observance which is not in
full tune with its goodness, may be worth much before men, but is
worth nothing before God.&nbsp; A father who has children at
home, in early years compels them by law to join the family
circle, and observe the laws and orders of the house.&nbsp; When
they are full grown, he tries to make the home attractive, and
leaves it to the sense of duty, love, and pleasure, to work
conformity.&nbsp; This Christian view of the Sabbath is the very
opposite of that which makes every day a Sabbath, and dishonours
the one.&nbsp; The endeavour to realize every day a Sabbath
feeling, if genuine and constant, will add fresh value to
<i>the</i> Sabbath of refreshment and repose; while a disposition
to slight the Lord&rsquo;s day, on the pretext of keeping all
days holy, will end in exhausting life of its spiritual element,
and destroying the very soul of man&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Having laid down these principles with regard to the Christian
Sabbath, in refutation of the rationalistic argument, let us
proceed to the practical application of them to the matter in
hand.&nbsp; The case is just this.&nbsp; An institution is about
to be formed and an exhibition opened, which must be regarded as
the legitimate fruit of the forty years&rsquo; peace which that
stern warrior conquered for us, whom we have just attended with
befitting splendour to his burial, whose mourners were a million
and a half of men.&nbsp; The Crystal Palace of last year was its
direct result&mdash;the World&rsquo;s Great Show&mdash;the
Jubilee of Commerce, celebrated with festal pomp in
London&mdash;the <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>heart of the body commercial&mdash;whence also had gone
forth, forty years ago, the head and the hands which had torn the
troubler of the world&rsquo;s peace from his throne, and
inaugurated the new era.&nbsp; England gained the victory, and at
the end of a long generation, unparalleled for activity and
enterprise in the history of man, she called the world to her
capital to see and to taste the fruits.&nbsp; Her grey old
warrior was spared to see it.&nbsp; The peaceful pageant of
commerce passed by him and did him homage, and then he was taken
to his rest.&nbsp; It is surely remarkable, that Wellington was
spared to see the crown of his labours&mdash;the fruit of
generations of peaceful activities, which will be marked in
history by his name&mdash;and then was removed before the event
was consummated which may cost the world another struggle, and
the blood of her bravest men.&nbsp; Such was the Crystal Palace
of 1851.</p>
<p>The Crystal Palace of 1853 will have another and profounder
character.&nbsp; It is an attempt to consecrate these fruits of
the world&rsquo;s strivings to the education and elevation of the
great masses, whom commerce has too long used up, and then flung
aside to perish.&nbsp; It is a deliberate effort to gather all
the ripest fruit of the world&rsquo;s most earnest strivings,
most glorious victories, and present them, in order to minister
to the development of the men, women, and children of the present
generation.&nbsp; It is no mere exhibition, except in the sense
in which the whole world is an exhibition.&nbsp; It is the
grandest conception of a hitherto mechanical and money-loving
generation, and has its root far deeper than in a desire for 5
per <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>cent.
returns.&nbsp; It grows up through the force of a conviction,
which is now wrought into the mind of the community, that the
intellect and wealth which commerce has developed, owe a ministry
to the people of the land; and that while the merchant princes
can pillage the Continent, Egypt, Palestine, India, and China, of
their treasures, to minister to their own vanity, amusement, or
instruction, the united strength of the intellect and wealth of
the country should build a Palace, far transcending all private
palaces, for the great people whose industry has made our England
the queen of the kingdoms of the earth.&nbsp; It is emphatically
a People&rsquo;s Palace, and the organization of it on this
gigantic scale, by men of shrewd understanding, is certainly a
sign that the tide of public feeling has turned towards higher,
more intellectual, more elevating pursuits and recreations, than
it affected some fifteen years ago.&nbsp; The fact that the
keenest speculators are now ransacking our world for the
treasures of art, science, and the early history of our race,
wherewith to adorn this Palace, is a proof that the very class
which has been most prone to renounce all the higher attributes
of humanity, and to make its life like that of the brutes that
perish, is beginning to resume the exercise of those higher
attributes, and to waken to a sense of what a man&rsquo;s life
includes.&nbsp; It is possible that many may regard this view of
the New Exhibition as overstrained.&nbsp; Many expect that people
will go to the Crystal Palace to see the sight, and, when they
have seen it, will go to the public-houses and finish
there.&nbsp; Such a view is both shallow and faithless.&nbsp; No
doubt, those who like to think so will <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>find plenty which will appear to
sustain their views.&nbsp; &ldquo;The people&rdquo; is a vague
term.&nbsp; It needs patient and intelligent observation, not on
the outskirts, but in the centre of a great popular movement, to
discern its character.&nbsp; The experience of the last few years
does not confirm such anticipations.&nbsp; The working classes,
who visit the Museum in Great Russell Street, the Zoological
Gardens on Monday, Hampton Court, and Kew, add nothing to the
disorder and drunkenness of the metropolis.&nbsp; It is
wonderfully rare, even in the more distant exhibitions and places
of intelligent enjoyment which have been mentioned, to meet with
disorder.&nbsp; Certainly, the drunkenness and disorder of London
have been greatly diminished by the opening of places of resort
for the working classes where mind as well as body may be
fed.&nbsp; Every thing in the past justifies the extension of the
experiment, and on the grandest scale.&nbsp; To the poor man,
these things are not so much exhibitions as they are to us who
can more frequent them.&nbsp; They partake of the dignity of
events, stir up the fountains of manhood, perhaps long stagnant,
and make him feel life&rsquo;s meaning and life&rsquo;s worth,
and thus they expand his soul.&nbsp; Now, it is worth while
seriously to consider&mdash;Is this <i>different</i> from the
object which God proposed in the institution of the Sabbath
day?&nbsp; It stops far short of that object; but, as far as it
goes, does it not travel in the same direction, and aim at the
lifting man up from the brutish condition into which a too
slavish daily toil would plunge him, to feel how much a man is
better than a brute?&nbsp; God, in the Sabbath institution, seeks
to make him feel that man is <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>so much better than a brute, that he
can talk to God as a Friend, and love Him as a Father.&nbsp; No
human effort can teach man that;&mdash;no Sabbath observance,
even of the strictest sort, can make man observe the Lord&rsquo;s
day, as the Lord counts observance; but when men, in the mass,
are gone so far from the Sabbath that they systematically
prostitute and pollute it, does God frown on human institutions,
which work, however slowly and dimly, towards the realization of
the benefit?&nbsp; Does He not say of all such, &ldquo;<i>Forbid
them not</i>, <i>for he that is not against us is on our
side</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; If through the unconscious influence of
Christianity, which has leavened even our speculating
fraternities, &ldquo;the earth is helping&rdquo; the Kingdom; if
the back-water of the mill-wheel of the Church has come round,
and is adding its strength to the current; let us look on it
lovingly and hopefully, as a state of things to be fostered and
led onward to what is better, in no wise to be resisted and
banned.&nbsp; And if men want to see this thing which is to
elevate and educate them on the Lord&rsquo;s day&mdash;the great
mass of the people being notoriously averse to the Sabbath of the
Church&mdash;we should not say, roughly and fiercely, &ldquo;You
shall not,&rdquo; but recognize it, as far as it goes, as a sign
of progress, hoping that, by all the humanizing influences which
are brought to bear on them, we may regain a hold on them, and
lead them on to a true appreciation of the Christian idea of the
Sabbath.&nbsp; The gist of the matter seems to lie here:&mdash;at
present, we have but slight hold on the working classes; they
care not for our Sabbaths, and find no pleasure in our
worship.&nbsp; <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Is it right, on the ground that it would be a formal
breach of that Sabbath which is now really and flagrantly
violated, to refuse our consent to a movement which will secure
for them some portion, at any rate, of benefit on the
Lord&rsquo;s day?</p>
<p>With many, much of the argument turns on this word
&ldquo;formal&rdquo; breach.&nbsp; It is worth while to consider
more fully its meaning, and to inquire into the real notions of
Sabbath observance which prevail in the Christian church.&nbsp;
We are all agreed, that the highest kind of good was contemplated
by God in the institution of the Sabbath; we are not all agreed
that, failing the highest good, a lesser good which is within our
reach may lawfully be secured.&nbsp; Many good people reason
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;The Sabbath is God&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; It is
the portion of man&rsquo;s time which He has cut off and
consecrated to himself; the mere time is His, as well as the
spirit of the worshipper; to recognize any secular employment of
such time, is to recognize a robbery of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this view of Sabbath observance it may be
objected&mdash;1.&nbsp; It recognizes a distinction in
<i>kind</i> between the common day and the sacred day, which has
no warrant in the New Testament Scripture.&nbsp; Is not
&ldquo;work&rdquo; a command, as well as
&ldquo;worship?&rdquo;&nbsp; And is not every commandment holy,
and obedience holy?&nbsp; Is it only on the first day that we are
to be fervent in spirit?&nbsp; Are we not to be serving the Lord
by diligence in business, with fervent spirit, every day in the
week, in our places of business, and the haunts of men?&nbsp; The
idea that the Sabbath is a kind of tribute paid to God, to allow
us to go free to work on week-days&mdash;<a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>a sort of
composition&mdash;is foreign both to the spirit and the letter of
the teaching of the New Testament.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s day is
to be a day of refreshing, of renewing of soul, that every day
may be a day of Divine service, and have more, not less, of the
sacred element infused into it.&nbsp; The idea of a tribute of
one day out of seven, false as it is, rules very much of the
feeling of the religious public on this question, and perhaps in
a measure affects all our hearts.&nbsp; But a second objection,
and a plainer one, to this view of the law of Sabbath observance,
is this:&mdash;there is hardly a Christian to be found who
professes practically to carry it out.&nbsp; How much of our
Sabbath is literally spent in devotion, how much in cheerful
converse with the family circle, how much in meals, how much in
criticism of the sermon, not always of a highly spiritual cast,
how much in passing references to the leading topics of the
day?&nbsp; Let us be honest and single-minded, and answer from
our consciences these questions.&nbsp; If we were to try our
Sabbath observance by that law which <i>did</i> consecrate the
time in its unity and completeness, which of us could
stand?&nbsp; Do we regard this as a sin?&nbsp; By no means;
because we feel that Christian Sabbath observance is in the
spirit, and not in the letter; in the direction of our thoughts
and desires without hindrance from the work-day world to God; in
the feeling of rest&mdash;of Sabbath calm&mdash;of holy peace and
joy&mdash;which has possessed us, and made our Sabbath more a
thing to be measured by the Spirit&rsquo;s instruments, and
registered in the Spirit&rsquo;s record, than by the clock.&nbsp;
And if a man has no homage to render, no spiritual good to gain,
because he desires none, what does he <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>gain, what does the Church gain, what
does the world gain, if he be compelled in some sort to recognize
it, by being debarred from a pursuit which would at any other
time be beneficial to him; provided always that his liberty be no
detriment to those who have better ways of spending the
day?&nbsp; Bring him to church to hear the Gospel!&nbsp; By all
means.&nbsp; I would that all places of pleasure were shut up on
Sabbaths, because men felt that they had better work on hand than
to visit them.&nbsp; But if the man says, &ldquo;I will not enter
your churches&mdash;I hate them;&rdquo;&mdash;we ask, where is
the gain to him, to any one, in saying, &ldquo;There are the
ale-houses, there are the tea-gardens&mdash;you are a sinner for
going, but there they are; there is, moreover, a train specially
provided by Government for you to travel; but this Crystal
Palace, so grand and beautiful, we can and will debar you
from.&nbsp; Whatever good it has to offer you, you shall not get
it on Sabbath days!&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems very foolish to confess
that all attempts to make the masses devote the hours of the
Sabbath to devotion are futile&mdash;that no serious limit can be
set successfully to the efforts of private speculators to tempt
men to demoralizing Sabbath desecration&mdash;and yet, when a
scheme is set on foot which aims at remedying in some sort the
mischief, by elevating instead of degrading men, because it is so
good and so complete as to be of national importance, its
progress is barred at once.</p>
<p>This is the true secret of much serious opposition.&nbsp; The
national character of this act is felt by many to be the chief
objection to it.&nbsp; Now let us understand what the word
&ldquo;national&rdquo; implies.&nbsp; There is, no doubt, a <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>very true
sense in which a Government represents a nation.&nbsp; But it may
represent truly or falsely; if falsely, does God regard it as the
representative of the national mind and will?&nbsp; If the nation
is bent on not keeping the Sabbath in the highest manner, would
the dictum of the Government against all other ways of spending
it, constitute a national Sabbath observance?&nbsp; All that we
could gain in that case would be an appearance&mdash;an
appearance how awfully contradicted in Clerkenwell, Rag-fair,
Lambeth, Chelsea, Greenwich, and in every place of dense
population or public resort.&nbsp; And does God care for this
appearance?&nbsp; Is it a cloak that hides any thing from his
eye?&nbsp; Think you, that it seems to Him a thing for the sake
of which it is worth while to sacrifice one instrument which may
help man out of the pit of brutal degradation which the Sabbaths
of this metropolis disclose to us, yawning in the very heart of
the wisest, the greatest, the richest, the most godly city in the
world?&nbsp; Many remember fondly what Sabbaths once were, and
willingly shut their eyes to the change.&nbsp; In spite of the
decent appearance of our streets&mdash;and God forbid that we
should ever lose it!&mdash;the reality is too decisively the
other way, for us to hope that a Government Act can give to us a
character before man or before God.&nbsp; The national thought
and feeling utters itself every year more loudly.&nbsp; It will
not help us, while the fire is raging, to batten down the
hatches, and step the deck as trimly as if the cry of alarm had
never been heard.&nbsp; We may shut the Crystal Palace and be no
nearer a national Sabbath keeping, nay, farther from it,&mdash;as
plagues pent up in the kilns of their own corruption <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>but taint the
air more widely, and cover with their black shadow a broader
surface of the land.</p>
<p>Some fear that the act of the Legislature will add a sanction
to Sabbath breaking by which many will be emboldened.&nbsp; Alas!
the balance is not so tremulous that the weight of Government in
either scale will make it kick the beam.&nbsp; It is to be feared
that many will frequent the Crystal Palace on Sunday, who
otherwise would be in the House of God.&nbsp; This is, no doubt,
a very serious matter, but a simply preventive legislation will
not remedy the moral mischief out of which the evil
springs.&nbsp; For such, no system of safeguards can be
successful.&nbsp; Men are beyond the reach of protection, who
would use the term &ldquo;national sanction&rdquo; as the cloak
of sin.</p>
<p>Thus much on the opposition arising from views of the nature
of Sabbath observance and its claims.&nbsp; We must now pass on
to notice a class of objections founded on the nature of the
Exhibition itself, and its probable influence on the heart, mind,
and manners of men.&nbsp; Many expect that men will get more harm
from the accessories than good from the thing itself.&nbsp; Here,
again, much is to be said on either side.&nbsp; There will,
doubtless, be beer-houses, tea-gardens, skittle-grounds, and all
the apparatus of demoralization (though the licensing magistrates
may do much to prevent it); but may we not fairly expect that
large numbers will spend, on their travelling and admission,
money which, if they stayed at home, would be drunk or played
away; that many will take their families with them, which is
always an elevating thing to the poor; that some, at any rate,
who go for pleasure, may <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>find deeper thoughts awakened, and
turn with disgust from grosser amusements which, in other states
of mind, would delight them; and that, on the whole, an immense
amount of vice and sensuality will be spared, though, alas, there
will be enough to waken sorrow in all good men.&nbsp; There will
just be a battle between the interest which the Crystal Palace
will awaken, and meaner, grosser things.&nbsp; Will the baser
triumph, when both are fairly brought to bear on men?&nbsp; There
is enough in the history of public exhibitions, during the last
twenty years, to rebuke our faithlessness and teach us
hope.&nbsp; My whole argument rests on the fact of existing and
increasing neglect of worship and church ordinances on the
Sabbath day.&nbsp; For how much of the existing disaffection the
Church is responsible, God only knoweth; but, certainly,
obstruction and prevention come from us with singularly bad
grace.&nbsp; Attraction is our one great power.&nbsp; What we can
attract and win, we keep.&nbsp; What we constrain we cannot
attach, and our chains are but ropes of sand.</p>
<p>One fruitful source of Sabbath desecration is the unnatural
condition in which men and women are compelled to live, in the
heart of our great cities.&nbsp; Every thing around them blights
the gentlest and most gracious thoughts and feelings of our
nature.&nbsp; They live from hand to mouth&mdash;they snatch at
each day&rsquo;s existence&mdash;they have no rest, no sense of
possession in the present, no hope for the future.&nbsp; They are
out of reach of true rest on the Sabbath.&nbsp; It is mere
mockery to talk about it.&nbsp; Keep them at home, and the
Sabbath cannot be a delight, except when an enthusiastic spirit
can wholly emancipate itself from circumstances.&nbsp; <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>God&rsquo;s
ordinance seems to them a delusion and a snare.&nbsp; Picture the
miserable houses, the foul air, the dirty, damp, mouldy walls,
the reeking smoke, the pestilential exhalations from the open
sewer, the cries of drunkenness, and the curses of blasphemy,
amidst which we expect half a million of men in our metropolis to
pass the Sabbath.&nbsp; No wonder that they fly from it, fly to
the ale-house, and drown there their disgust and despair.&nbsp;
They are hardly within reach of our Christian
instructions,&mdash;alas, for the seed sown in such stony
ground!&nbsp; The circumstances of their life expose it to
fearful peril; a broad change must pass over the moral and mental
condition of these people before, <i>as a class</i>, they can be
expected to receive gladly the Gospel and bring forth its
fruits.&nbsp; Let them get out to something they will care
for&mdash;something that will teach them&mdash;God&rsquo;s clear
air and sunshine, the violet odour, balmy to them as the breath
of Paradise, the bird song, the breeze among the boughs, the
fresh clean meadows, the sparkling wreathing river, and they are
at once within reach of better and holier thoughts.&nbsp; Or if
no thoughts come to them, for impressions shape themselves into
thoughts but slowly in minds inept, yet a genial refreshing dew
has passed over their spirits&mdash;they feel that the city life,
with its squalor and misery, is man&rsquo;s work not
God&rsquo;s,&mdash;and at last, though the thought may be long in
ripening, they may come to think that it may be true after all,
as the Bible says, that in God the poor man has a defender and
keeper, and a remedy for all the ills which sin and selfishness
have entailed upon the world.</p>
<p>Those who see much of this class will be deeply <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>convinced
that we have no means of reaching them at present as a class,
though the direct and earnest attention of the Church, in all its
branches, to their condition and needs, is a most hopeful
symptom; but looking at this great class, and their relation to
society&mdash;so benighted, so withered in soul, as to resist
sternly the Divinest influences&mdash;I confess it seems to me a
terrible responsibility to keep them away, on any day, from
anything which would do them even a little good.&nbsp; It is but
little that we can hope, and that little will be slowly
realized.&nbsp; With sorrow we open the way for
them&mdash;sorrow, that they will not choose a more excellent
way.&nbsp; We believe in God&rsquo;s high purpose in the
institution of the Sabbath day, and fling wide the gates of our
sanctuaries.&nbsp; But if men pass scornfully or scowlingly, let
us at least be thankful, tearfully thankful, if they are not
passing by our doors to dens of vice and crime.&nbsp; Let us not
tell them, If you do not come here, the Lord does not care where
you go.&nbsp; Let us tell them that <span class="smcap">He</span>
follows them everywhere with His care,&mdash;that <span
class="smcap">He</span> has spread abroad the expanse of nature
for them,&mdash;that He has given art, science, commerce, and
history to man;&mdash;it may chance that many, hearing this, may
desire to know more of Him, and learn from himself what He means
by a Sabbath day.</p>
<p>It may be said, and with justice, that the majority of the
frequenters of the Crystal Palace will hardly be of the class
which has been described.&nbsp; Not the poorest, but the class
above the poorest&mdash;the well-paid artizans, the shopmen and
shopwomen, the mercantile clerks and the kindred classes will
furnish at any rate a large proportion of the visitors to this
Exhibition.&nbsp; <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>It is worth one&rsquo;s while to consider thoughtfully
whether we are prepared to apply the same rigid rule, as regards
the measure of time to be devoted to public services on the
Lord&rsquo;s day, to the poor workman and shopman confined to the
hot dense air of the factory or shop during all the disposable
hours of the week, and living probably in a home but sparely
visited by the light and air of heaven,&mdash;between which home
and the sanctuary he ought, according to the present theory, to
divide his time on the Sabbath,&mdash;and to the rich man who, in
the afternoon or evening, can walk in his own garden, pluck the
fruit of his own vine and fig-tree, ventilate his lungs in the
purest and balmiest air, and, being refreshed in body, can go
down to God&rsquo;s house in comfort and refresh his soul.&nbsp;
We must beware, lest we make the lot of the poor more bitter by
the yoke of our law of ordinances which are in themselves
beautiful and benignant, lest he take the name of his God in
vain.&nbsp; Many hold forth a rest day in the week as the
remedy.&nbsp; This simply means, in most cases, the sacrifice of
four or five shillings a week.&nbsp; Six days&rsquo; labour can
hardly supply the needs of a poor man&rsquo;s family, especially
its higher needs.&nbsp; The loss of some shillings is certainly
the loss of some books, some schooling, some innocent amusements
for his children, and is, not seldom, the loss of bread.</p>
<p>The last, and in the estimation of a large number of religious
men, the most serious aspect of the question which I will refer
to is this:&mdash;&ldquo;The opening of the Crystal
Palace,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;is but the door to the opening
of the national institutions, the theatres, and, finally, the
factories and shops on the Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>But
there is evidently a limiting principle at work, recognized by
the public, and expressed by the Government.&nbsp; The limitation
of the hours, the clause against the sale of spirituous liquors,
and the close of that portion of the building which would involve
actual handiwork, are recognized by the public at once as right
and seemly.&nbsp; There is a public feeling in England which will
care for these things, which are supposed to be imperilled; a
public feeling which, during the next years, it will be the
office of the Church to nurture and unfold.&nbsp; If that public
feeling fail us, then, unquestionably, our condition will be most
serious; and the question must be argued, how far a Government
may maintain, in the face of public feeling, a system of
preventions and prohibitions?&nbsp; That it has the right, up to
a certain point, most people feel; that there is a point beyond
which it is most unsafe, all are agreed.&nbsp; But that point
will never be reached in England, while the Church is faithful to
her country and to her Lord.&nbsp; If that point ever be reached,
on us will be the sin.&nbsp; Ministers of the Church of Christ!
there has been too long a schism in the army.&nbsp; The shepherds
have been battling for precedence and prerogative, and the sheep
have strayed.&nbsp; The call to us now is for work;
work&mdash;not by platform crudities, vanities, and falsities;
not by protests, preventions, petitions, and bills of spiritual
rights;&mdash;but by earnest, manful, godly, spiritual effort to
make the Gospel known and felt as the power of God unto
salvation.&nbsp; The power of the Gospel is not felt as it once
was.&nbsp; Admirable sermons are preached, and with admirable
emphasis and <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>theatric art, but power does not go forth from
them.&nbsp; Men look at us, hear us, admire us, but our
prehensile power is gone.&nbsp; We do not lay hold on men.&nbsp;
We have dealt too much in a religion of exclusions and
negations.&nbsp; We need to take hold on men, and
say,&mdash;&ldquo;We have good news&mdash;good news of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cry, &ldquo;Good news! light! bread!
life!&rdquo; should be heard more loudly from our pulpits.&nbsp;
We should not lack hearers, if we could make them feel that we
had good news to tell.&nbsp; Were our Master among us at this
crisis, He would not work by protests and prohibitions.&nbsp;
Wherever the people were, there would He be, vehement against
organized hypocritic wickedness, but patient, gentle, merciful to
the souls gone astray in their darkness and misery.&nbsp; Oh,
that our hearts could catch that tone of touching human
tenderness wherewith He would address this weary and burdened
generation, &ldquo;<i>Come unto me</i>, <i>all ye that are weary
and heavy laden</i>, <i>and I will give you
rest</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But He is with us alway, and, by ways that
we little discern and sympathize with, He may be leading this
generation to himself.&nbsp; Let us be humble-hearted and full of
charity; let us work, work harder and more lovingly, with more
oneness of heart and voice, to make men feel that it is
God&rsquo;s good news to them which we have in charge, and then
will our Sabbaths return to us, fresh and pure, beautiful and
blest, as that George Herbert wrote of.</p>

day most calm, most bright,<br />

Writ by a friend, and with his blood;<br />
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>The couch

The week were dark, but for thy light:<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Man

To endless death: but thou dost pull<br />

Since there is no place so alone,<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
